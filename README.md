# NintendoDB

This is going to be a DB related to the best selling games in the Nintendo Console. 

My First Task is to create the (Data Factory using Azure). 

Second Task is to link this to a Azure Data Brinks session

Third task would be to create a Resource Group, Storage Acct, and finally a Synapse WorkSpace. 

Synapse could be my one and only application I would need to Create the Data Lake and Data Factory however this is to showcase my proficency in the other Softwares and see where my capabilities are at right now. 

Finail Step is using Power Bi or Tablue to create the Data Visulization of this Project and Developing the questions for the SQL Queries.
